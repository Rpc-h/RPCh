# Sandbox

## Description

Sandbox is a docker-compose file that aims to emulate the whole RPCh stack locally through docker.

This includes:

- running local RPC node
- running local HOPRd node which uses the RPC node (acts as entry node)
- running intermediary nodes
- running HOPRd and RPCh exit nodes
